We are The SA Launcher Foundation. We have come to create a server hosting app for minecraft. Not some website with a time limit, or memory limitations, or even a limit on how many plugins you can use! No. We come with an app (in development) coded in javascript that will soot your needs for a minecraft server.





! IMPORTANT !
THIS APP WILL HAVE TO BE INSTALLED AND IS CURRENTLY IN BETA! WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RELEASE THIS UNTIL 2021. WE ARE CURRENTLY 0% DONE WITH THE PROJECT. BETA TESTERS WILL HAVE TO EMAIL US @ salauncher@aol.com! WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ERRORS INVOLVING THE MINECRAFT SERVER SUCH AS PLUGIN ERRORS, CONFIG ERRORS, OR BUGS WITH IN-GAME ACTIVITY!
