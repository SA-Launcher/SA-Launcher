We are The SA Launcher Foundation. We have come to create a server hosting app for Minecraft. Not some website with a time limit, or memory limitations, or even a limit on how many plugins you can use! No. We come with an app (in development) coded in Java that will suit your needs for a Minecraft server.


We plan on eventually adding web application, remote access, and a mobile application. **THIS WILL TAKE TIME, SO DON'T EXPECT IT ANYTIME SOON**


! IMPORTANT !
THIS APP WILL HAVE TO BE INSTALLED AND IS CURRENTLY IN BETA! RELEASE DATE IS TO BE DETERMINED AT A LATER DATE. WE ARE CURRENTLY 0% DONE WITH THE PROJECT. BETA TESTERS WILL HAVE TO EMAIL US AT salauncher@aol.com! WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ERRORS INVOLVING THE MINECRAFT SERVER SUCH AS PLUGIN ERRORS, CONFIG ERRORS, OR BUGS WITH IN-GAME ACTIVITY!
